  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Villager Bot collects limited, non-sensitive data in order to provide its intended function. This data
    is not shared with third parties and is used solely for Bot functionality.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Profiles are created upon the first use of any function requiring the user's profile. Each profile stores the
      user's ID and the Discord server's ID, which are provided by Discord. Other data stored includes timestamps, deck
      information, and upgrade progress. Data is stored on a per-server basis.
    </li>
    <li>
      Certain features may allow users to update this data. These updates may include user-provided content (e.g. deck
      name), which may be considered identifiable or sensitive. This data is stored securely and used only for its
      stated purpose.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discord usernames are not stored, but the Bot may temporarily fetch them through Discord's API to display on
      leaderboards, which may be visible in servers the user is not in. The user can opt out of global leaderboards
      with the /private user command or by requesting their data be manually privated in the support server. Similarly,
      server admins can use /private server command to opt out of global server leaderboards.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stored data is backed up in the cloud daily. Backups are permanently deleted after three days.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <br>
  <h2>Data Deletion</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Removing the Bot from an existing server triggers automatic deletion of all data related to that server.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using the reset slash command will also delete all information relating to the user in the server. If the Bot is
      offline, these deletions may not occur.
    </li>
    <li>
      Users can also request a manual deletion at any time via the Bot's official support server.
    </li>
  </ul>
