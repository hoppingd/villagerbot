  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>This Terms of Service Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into between the developer ("Bot Owner") and the
    user ("User") of the Villager Bot Discord bot (the "Bot").</p>

  <p>By using the Bot, the User agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If the User does not agree to the
    terms of this Agreement, they should immediately discontinue use of the Bot.</p>

  <h2>Bot Terms</h2>
  <p>1. Use of the Bot: The Bot Owner grants the User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to use the Bot
    for personal or non-commercial purposes.</p>

  <p>2. Prohibited Use: The User may not use the Bot in any way that violates applicable laws, rules, or regulations or
    infringes upon the rights of any third party. The User may not use the Bot for any commercial purposes without the
    express written consent of the Bot Owner.</p>

  <p>3. Limitation of Liability: The Bot Owner shall not be liable for any damages arising out of the use or inability to
    use the Bot, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data, or other intangible
    losses.</p>

  <p>4. Modifications to the Bot: The Bot Owner may modify or discontinue the Bot at any time without notice. The User
    agrees that the Bot Owner shall not be liable to the User or any third party for any modification, suspension, or
    discontinuance of the Bot.</p>

  <p>5. Intellectual Property: This Bot is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or created by Nintendo. The Bot Owner makes
    no claims to ownership of Nintendo's assets, trademarks, or intellectual property. Character data is sourced from
    Nookipedia. All remaining intellectual property rights are and shall remain the property of the Bot Owner, including
    but not limited to the Bot's design, profile picture, original emoticons, and original written content.</p>

  <p>6. Data Collection: By inviting or using the Bot, the User agrees to the collection and use of data as outlined in

    User must immediately cease all use of the Bot.</p>

  <h2>Open Source Code Terms</h2>
  <p>9. Status of Code: At any time, the Bot may be open source. The Bot Owner reserves the right to revoke the Bot's
    open source status. While the Bot is open source, the User is free to view, fork, and repurpose the code for
    personal or educational projects, subject to the following restrictions (10-12).</p>

  <p>10. Usage and Modification: The User may use and modify the Bot's source code for their own projects. They may not
    copy, mirror, or clone the Bot as-is and publish or deploy it under a different name or branding. Any significant
    reuse of the code must result in a distinct and original project.</p>

  <p>12. Warranty: The Bot and its source code are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. The Bot Owner
    is not responsible for any damage, loss, or legal issues resulting from your use of the Bot or its code.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>13. Future Changes: The Bot Owner reserves the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be
    communicated via the repository or Bot support channels.</p>

  <p>14. Entire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior or
    contemporaneous agreements or representations, whether written or oral, relating to the Bot.</p>

    its terms and conditions.</p>
